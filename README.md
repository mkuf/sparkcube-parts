# sparkcube-parts
Modifications for the Sparklabs Sparkcube. <br>
<br>
All Parts can be printed without support. <br>
In Places where support is needed, there are small membranes that need to be drilled out after printing. <br>
See the "support" Folder in every FreeCAD File.

## accessories_holder
Neat little box to store a USB-Drive and -Cable <br>

## case
Main File for anything related to the outer shell of the Printer. <br> 
These files are not compatible with the original Sparkcube, as my Printer is larger in X and Z. <br>
<br>
It sports a Electronics-Compartment made from bent Sheetmetal, Cutouts for fitting a Udoo Quad/Dual Board and a Touchscreen LCD Display. <br>

## dual-x
With these Parts, a stock Sparkcube may be upgraded to use two independent Extruders for printing. <br>
Be aware that this reduces your Printarea in X by quite a bit. I recommend building your whole printer about 70mm wider. <br>
The design of these parts is inspired by the original Sparklab parts, but are not compatible with any of them (except the Z-Assembly of course). <br>

## mpx-clip
A simple piece that clips around a MPX Connector to prevent it from accidential disconnecting. <br>

## Webcam-Mount
A fixture to mount the PCB of a Logitech C270 Webcam to a Aluminium Extrusion without the need of any Screws. <br>
Just insert the Posts sideways into the Profile, rotate them 90Â°, screw in the baseplate and you're done. <br>

## z-endstop-adapter
Use this if you prefer to use an M3 Screw for your Z-Endstop instead of an M5 one. <br>
Requires an aditional Hole in the Z-Gantry to secure it in place. <br>
